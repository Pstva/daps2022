    "+ **Dependence**: B is dependent on A since A is the parent of B. This relationship can be written as a conditional probability: P(B|A). D is also dependent on other variables, and in this case, it depends on two of them — B and C. Again, this can be written as a conditional probability: P(D|B,C).\n",
    "+ **Conditional Independence**: D is considered conditionally independent of A. This is because as soon as we know whether event B has happened, A becomes irrelevant from the perspective of D. In other words, the following is true: P(D|B,A) = P(D|B)."
